<font color='#7289DA' size='1'>Random Review with 4 Star rating from Wednesday, 24/04/2019.</font><br> <font color='white' size='3'>PEEKY is a bot with lots of functions, an active server and regular updates, keeping the bot unique and good to use. The bot has an easy to understand website with a command list and details, in addition to a trello board to keep users up to date on the somewhat frequent changes and bug fixes to the bot. I recommend PEEKY, as despite it's bugs and occassional problems it has many functions and is easy to use, although it does use the same command prefix as some other popular discord bots.</font>  <br><br>  <center><font color='#7289DA' size='1'>Your review must be atleast 200 characters long to show up here.</font></center>
