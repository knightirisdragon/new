Starting with PEEKY
</font>

<u>1. How to use PEEKY?</u>  <br>
<font size="2">
You can start using PEEKY the big way by getting familiar with the <a href="commands.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="HomeHyperlinks">commands</a>.
</font>
  
<br>
<br>

<u>2. How to use the functions?</u>  <br>
<font size="2">
Setting up PEEKY's functions is super easy once you get the hang of it!  <br><br>

After you've got familiar with the commands, you know that you only need to use p!set and p!toggle to change a function's behaviour.  <br>
You can use both commands by typing the command and then the function's Command Name, which you can find by in the Tutorials page.  <br><br>

The Toggle command toggles between the function's state, which can be on or off.  <br>
It can also create channels under the correct circumstances (which means just having the default permissions).

<br><br>

The Set command on the other hand changes a function's setting, which differs with each function.  <br>
You can see what the settings do for each functions in the Overview command.
  
</font>
  
<br>
<br>

<u>3. What are the functions types?</u>  <br>
<font size="2">
All the functions are arranged into two types: Channel type and Server type.  <br>
You can see the type of a function in the Overview command.  <br><br>

The Server type means that the function is always gonna be enabled or disabled for the whole server  <br>
and the Channel type means that the function can be enabled or disabled in every channel in the server.
