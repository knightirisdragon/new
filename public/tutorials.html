<font size="5" class="item_header">
Starting with PEEKY
</font>
<div class="tutorial_item">

<u>1. How to use PEEKY?</u>  <br>
<font size="2">
You can start using PEEKY the big way by getting familiar with the <a href="commands.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="HomeHyperlinks">commands</a>.
</font>
  
<br>
<br>

<u>2. How to use the functions?</u>  <br>
<font size="2">
Setting up PEEKY's functions is super easy once you get the hang of it!  <br><br>

After you've got familiar with the commands, you know that you only need to use Set and Toggle to change a function's behaviour.  <br>
You can use both commands by typing the command and then the function's Command Name, which you can find by in the Functions page.  <br><br>

The Toggle command toggles between the function's state, which can be on or off.  <br>
It can also create channels and roles under the correct circumstances (which means just having the default permissions).

<br><br>

The Set command on the other hand changes a function's setting, which differs with each function.  <br>
You can see what the settings do for each functions in the Overview command.

<br><br>

There's also a Clear command that basically clears the setting of a function that uses arrays as it's setting.  <br>
For example; the Banned Words function has an array of banned words that can be cleared using this command.
  
</font>
  
<br>
<br>

<u>3. What are the functions types?</u>  <br>
<font size="2">
All the functions are arranged into two types: Channel type and Server type.  <br>
You can see the type of a function in the Overview command.  <br><br>

The Server type means that the function is always gonna be enabled or disabled for the whole server  <br>
and the Channel type means that the function can be enabled or disabled in every channel in the server.

Custom reaction emojis for the Automatic Reactions function
</font>
<div class="tutorial_item">

<u>1. Uploading the server emojis.</u>  <br>
<font size="2">
First of, you wanna go to your server settings and upload 2 emojis that should represent a pair of rating buttons.
</font>
  
<br>
<br>

<u>2. Checking the Automatic Reaction setting.</u>  <br>
<font size="2">
You can get the function list and see the settings of Automatic Reactions by typing <i>p!overview</i>. <br>
Then you wanna copy the two names in the setting and rename the two emojis you've uploaded to be the same as in the setting.
</font>
  
<br>
<br>

<u>3. Result</u>  <br>
<font size="2">
And you should be set! Now just post an image and see if it worked.

How to use the Timestamps for the Event Countdown function
</font>
<div class="tutorial_item">

<u>1. How do I convert a date to a timestamp?</u>  <br>
<font size="2">
Here's a website that you can use to convert dates to a timestamp, <a href="https://currentmillis.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="HomeHyperlinks">https://currentmillis.com</a>.
</font>
  
<br>
<br>

<u>2. My countdown is not updating.</u>  <br>

The Server Message function and it's Tags
</font>
<div class="tutorial_item">

<u>1. What are Tags?</u>  <br>
<font size="2">
The Tags in the Server Message function are a great thing that let you customize your server message even more!  <br>
In this tutorial you'll learn how to use them what they each tag can do.
</font>
  
<br>
<br>

<u>2. How to use Tags?</u>  <br>
<font size="2">
You can use the tags just by typing them between square brackets like [This] in the function's setting.  <br>
You'll know if it worked by getting a "Tag was detected" message right after setting the Server Message function.
</font>
  
<br>
<br>

<u>3. What Tags are there?</u>  <br>
<font size="2">
These are the Tags that you can currently use:  <br><br>
[GuildName] - Shows the server's current name.  <br>
[GuildSize] - Shows the amount of members in the server. Excludes bots.  <br>
[GuildOwner] - Shows server's current owner.  <br>
[GuildLevel] - Shows the current verification level.  <br>
[GuildAcronym] - Shows the server's Acronym.

About the Workshop and backgrounds
</font>
<div class="tutorial_item">

<u>1. Submitting a background</u>  <br>
<font size="2">
The parameters that PEEKY uses for the profiles is 500x300.
  
<br><br>
  
This is the format that you should use when submitting a background to the Workshop:

<br><br>
  
<code>
Name: [text] <br>
Credit: [text]  <br>
Price: [number]
</code>
  
<br><br>
  
Having an invalid format or not attaching your background will get your submission automatically deleted.  <br>
Posting something NSFW, racist, or anything of that sort will get you banned from submitting to the Workshop.
</font>

<br>
<br>

<u>2. Background Revenue?</u>  <br>
<font size="2">
Background revenue means that the background's artist gets some Gredit from the background's sales.  <br>
You can see if a background has revenue enabled when it says "Revenue Enabled" under it's price tag.
  
<br><br>
  
To get revenue enabled on your background, keep in mind that:  <br>
- You must be the background's original author or have a special permission from the original artist.  <br>
- Your profile must be active, otherwise the revenue will be turned off until you get one.
</font>

<br>
<br>

<u>3. Exclusive backgrounds?</u>  <br>
<font size="2">
  
Only PEEKY's developers can add Exclusive backgrounds to the Workshop.
  
<br><br>

Exclusive backgrounds are backgrounds that cannot be bought with Gredit, but instead have to be earned through special events and so on.  <br>
Selling an exclusive background will give you no Gredit.

Some tips about the Store
</font>
<div class="tutorial_item">

<u>1. How do I get my items?</u>  <br>
<font size="2">
You should normally get a DM from PEEKY saying that the items have been added to your profile right after you purchase said items.  <br>
If you don't receive the DM, try waiting a few hours or restart your client.
</font>
  
<br>
<br>

<u>2. How do I get a refund?</u>  <br>
<font size="2">
The steps on how to issue a refund are in the Refund Policy page.
</font>
  
<br>
<br>

<u>3. Re-purchasing the Supporter item</u>  <br>
<font size="2">
Once you purchase the Supporter item, you will hold the Supporter status for 30 days.  <br>
After the 30 days, PEEKY will remove the status and notify you, after which you have 5 days to re-purchase it in order to not lose the date of the initial purchase.

About the Auto Wipe system
</font>
<div class="tutorial_item">

<u>1. What is this?</u>  <br>
<font size="2">
Auto Wipe is a system that helps PEEKY by removing inactive or unavailable servers and profiles.
</font>
  
<br>
<br>

<u>2. Normal Servers</u>  <br>
<font size="2">
PEEKY will leave a server and delete it's settings if it has been inactive for more than 20 days.  <br>
Servers can update their Auto Wipe status by using PEEKY's functions and commands.
</font>
  
<br>
<br>

<u>3. Upgraded Servers</u>  <br>
<font size="2">
Upgraded servers are completely immune to Auto Wipe.
</font>
  
<br>
<br>

<u>4. Profiles</u>  <br>
<font size="2">
Any profile that are not available to PEEKY or don't have the Fashion badge will get deleted after 20 days of inactivity.  <br>
Profiles can update their Auto Wipe status by using PEEKY's commands.
</font>

Help with the Server List
</font>
<div class="tutorial_item">

<u>1. How do I get my server on the list?</u>  <br>
<font size="2">
The server list is a reward for anyone that has upgraded their servers.  <br>
Go to the store to upgrade your server!
</font>
  
<br>
<br>

<u>2. How do I update my server's invite link?</u>  <br>
<font size="2">
To update your invite link in the server list, you have to make a permanent invite and then use the SetInvite command.
</font>
  
<br>
<br>

<u>3. My upgraded server is not on the list?</u>  <br>
<font size="2">
It takes some time for the list to update.  <br>
If your server still is not on the list, it may be because PEEKY is not on the upgraded server.
